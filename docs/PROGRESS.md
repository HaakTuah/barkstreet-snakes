# Progress

What is done and what comes next, in order (how to work through it: `AGENTS.md`). Mark an item done here, with its PR,
when it is merged into `develop`; add the owner's new tasks where he places them, with his words quoted.

## State

The first open entry below is next. The older state notes (27 October 2026) are in `docs/archive/plan-history.md`.

**2 November 2026, a fresh week:** the main lane is part 4 (#198), then 2x, then part 5 (#202, parked); the polish
lane and the workshop lane run beside it, each claimed by a draft PR. The older state notes are in
`docs/archive/plan-history.md`.

## For the owner

Everything for the owner is an issue: [questions and readings](https://github.com/HaakTuah/barkstreet-snakes/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afor-owner)
(`for-owner`) and [ideas](https://github.com/HaakTuah/barkstreet-snakes/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aidea) (`idea`), by
"Questions, readings and ideas" in `AGENTS.md`. Answered rows from before 2 November 2026: `docs/archive/progress-done.md`,
"For the owner, answered".

## The polish lane

A side lane of small refinements, beside the AI and engine lane and never ahead of it (the owner, 31 October 2026: "Should
we add a polish point to each that it can spend the last credits on also?" and, to the design session's shape of it,
"Yes, and make things as refined as possible!"). Taken when the main lane's current entry is merged or parked, and on
the second account until its usage is spent; on the main account the brake closes it first (from about 85%).
- **First, the housekeeping:** done (PR #222, and the design session's move of the open entries' specs to
  `docs/handoff/queue-specs.md`, 31 October 2026); merged branches now go by GitHub's "Automatically delete head
  branches", and the older ones went by the "Delete merged branches" button in Actions (31 October 2026). Then archive leftovers nobody uses.
- **What belongs:** whatever makes the game feel finished without changing how it plays: things drawn wrong, out of
  place, overlapping, flickering or cut off; the same thing drawn, named or worded differently in two places (a
  rival's colours, a move's name in the lesson and the Field guide); layout at 390 px and desktop, phone held upright and
  sideways, reduced motion, tap targets and contrast; typos and wording in banners, chatter, the Field guide and
  menus; errors or warnings in the console; sound levels that jar; slow frames that can be made smooth.
- **What does not:** anything that changes a rule, a number, a rival's play or the online messages; those go to their
  entries.
- **How:** look for them by playing the live build, on a phone-sized screen and on desktop, through every screen, a
  lesson, an online lobby, and whole rounds watched at top speed; each find is its own small PR (about half an hour),
  with a before-and-after picture on `pr-media`, the suites green and the simulation's fingerprints unchanged (seeds 3
  and 11), so nothing that changes play slips in; merged at once, one line per fix under this lane. Nothing is left
  half done: a fix not finished when usage ends is left unstarted, its find noted for the next session.

- **Next, from the owner's notes of 2 November** (his words: `docs/archive/instructions.md`), one PR each: **every
  snake's remains match the body they came from** ("Remains" in `docs/design/04-food-and-the-world.md`): The owner saw it
  on Star, but `beadOf` in `render/food.js` has three faults. A dead snake's beads take their pattern by bead count, not
  by the segment they came from, so every patterned rival's comes out squeezed (Wildcard, Joker, Sniper, Vulture,
  Desperado, Mason, Colonist); Star's and Copycat's beads go round six fixed hues from red, while their bodies show a
  running, fading rainbow; and crash drops and cut tails carry only the base colour. Each bead takes the fill and mark
  its segment had at that moment; **flags fall with the log** when a gap opens under them, as the piece does,
  instead of jumping (food's own fall is entry 6's A/B); and **the spit's tell**: the cheek's bulge counts down to the
  spit, so a player sees when it comes (where it flies is 3b+'s dotted line).

*Done in the lane:* each fix's line is in `docs/archive/progress-done.md`, "The polish lane, done" (the README for
players, any key wakes, the woodpecker bigger on a phone, the flash become the dash, the room card and Join on a phone, among them).

## The workshop lane (splits by meaning, leftovers, the file-by-file review)

- **First, at the next milestone** (the owner, 1 November 2026): the workshop check's point (2) before anything else.
  `AGENTS.md` is 19 KB since its standing instructions became rules (2 November); this file (20 KB) goes back under
  about 20 KB, done entries and answered questions moving to `docs/archive/` with a line pointing there.
- **The unused-code check** (the workshop check's point 5; draft PR #331), then **the file-by-file review** (the owner,
  2 November 2026): its spec is in `docs/handoff/queue-specs.md` under the same title.
- *Done:* `audio.js` and `chatter/zh.js` split (PRs #225, #226), and the chatter split by meaning (PR #318):
  `docs/archive/progress-done.md`, "The split lane, done".
- **Waiting for the main lane** (PR #198 and its parked #202 have them open): `ai.js` (139 KB), `engine.js` (128 KB) and
  `render/world.js` (51 KB). Split each in a PR of its own once the main lane merges, proven by fingerprints and suites.

## The queue, in order

**Done:** every finished entry, 1 to 2w, with its PR, is in `docs/archive/progress-done.md`, "The queue, done".

### 2x. The spitter slides over its own mushroom (the owner, 2 November 2026; an engine-rules entry, next, ahead of part 5)

Taken out of 3b+ and moved to the front, since it still bites (the owner: "Still get the bug with swallowing a mushroom over and over again after puking it up."): the spec is 3b+'s "The spitter slides over its own mushroom" in `docs/handoff/queue-specs.md`, entry 5.

### 5. Round six B: the new moves (DESIGN "Round six B"); next AI entry, right after Copycat's part of 3b

The golden jump that flies, leap now, gold portals, dropped charges, the spit along the line and one pricing model for every power, each its own playable PR that the rivals use well. *Done:* parts 1, 2, 3 and 3b (PRs #158, #174, #183, #195). **Next, in order:** part 4 (draft PR #198, 2r folded in; the owner answered on 1 November 2026 that the moves stay as designed and the rivals are improved until their users come out ahead: the row is in `docs/archive/progress-done.md`, "For the owner, answered"), then 2q (2s done, PR #289; part 4's both-ways test runs again on its log when part 4 goes on), part 3b+ (the spit flies along the line), part 5 (#202, gold portals), part 6 (built on `round6b/dropped-charges`) and part 7 (parked on `round6b/pricing`; it also fixes the trademark measures and lifts Joker into the band, see the spec); then the teaching system (item 4). Spec: `docs/handoff/queue-specs.md`, "5. Round six B: the new moves". **When part 4 merges:** run the census on seeds 3 and 11 again (`scripts/sim.sh 200 --seed 3 --census --check`): chased beetles must still get away a third to 45% of the time (2w measured it before the flight was in; `--check` fails a census outside that band).

### 2r. No hop onto a doomed island (30 October 2026; part of item 5's part 4)

Before a hop or a flight a rival weighs where it lands, above all whether it can jump off again; built into part 4 (#198). Spec: `docs/handoff/queue-specs.md`, "2r. No hop onto a doomed island".

### 2q. Rivals notice like people (30 October 2026; an AI entry, after 2s)

Every rival sees another snake as late as a person would notice it: `REACTION_MS` near its own head, growing to about 400 ms across the board, measured with `tools/abtest.js`. Spec: `docs/handoff/queue-specs.md`, "2q. Rivals notice like people".

### 2b. Hunger's worth at a contested apple, for every rival (the owner, 29 October 2026; an AI entry)

A contested apple is worth what it saves: a starving rival contests it because it is worth more; Gobbler contests even when fed; Desperado is less risk-averse everywhere. Spec: `docs/handoff/queue-specs.md`, "2b. Hunger's worth at a contested apple, for every rival".

### 2h. The endgame: eat what keeps you alive, not what boxes you in (the owner, 29 October 2026; an AI entry, after 2b)

Grown on 31 October 2026: the tail drop planned ahead, a length target (a crash and hunger buffer, no more), and the denial play where it pays; the reasoning now, its numbers again after entry 6.

In the endgame a meal is worth the life it buys against the room it costs: a rival eats when hunger would end it before room would. Spec: `docs/handoff/queue-specs.md`, "2h. The endgame: eat what keeps you alive, not what boxes you in".

### 2i. Food seasons: lean, normal and plentiful rounds (the owner, 29 October 2026; an engine-rules entry, after 2h)

Each round draws a food season, lean, normal or plentiful, seen in a start banner, taught, and played by the rivals; online with a protocol bump. Spec: `docs/handoff/queue-specs.md`, "2i. Food seasons: lean, normal and plentiful rounds".

### 3. Fixes and polish (the owner's playtest of 2026-10-20)

Its done entries (PRs #49 to #124) are in `docs/archive/progress-done.md`, "Item 3, done".

### 3b. The rivals who change: Capricious, Copycat and Wildcard (Wildcard's part after 5)

Capricious done (PR #126) and Copycat done (PR #142). **Wildcard's part waits** until after 5, built on the branch `wildcard-shows-its-mix`; its "left to do" is in the spec. Spec: `docs/handoff/queue-specs.md`, "3b. The rivals who change: Capricious, Copycat and Wildcard".

### 3c. A new rival: the Charmer (the owner, 29 October 2026; an AI entry, after 2b and 3b)

Charmer, a vain show-off who courts the biggest snake on the board and steals its meals; his look and his mark on death wait for the owner's description. Spec: `docs/handoff/queue-specs.md`, "3c. A new rival: the Charmer".

### 4. The teaching system, steps 2–6 (DESIGN "Teaching by showing") — after 5, whose new moves it must teach

Teaches every move of item 5 by showing, each with its picture or cue, its lesson and its Field guide row; it starts as soon as item 5's last part merges, as a lane of its own. Spec: `docs/handoff/queue-specs.md`, "4. The teaching system, steps 2–6".

### 6. Round six C: the woodpecker in three acts

The draft is in `docs/handoff/woodpecker-acts-draft.md`.

- **Its pace and fairness, and hunger in the endgame** (the owner, 31 October 2026: "Sounds good! though I think it should take fewer chunks at once as a rule, because the map shrinks really quickly now! and i also think when there is just a little bit of space, it should slow down again, so it isn't and rng competition where it is who's island it pecks at next that decides it, capiche? Whats your take?" Then, to the design session's take: "Yes, to everything, expertly! and i also want hunger to be a factor! right now, food and beads jjust become a negative at the end. if we manage to balance this right, we can make it a trade-off, just like we tried with everything else, like mushrooms. that's a sign of good game design, conditional goods. thomas sowell in game mechanics."). These come before the draft's numbers and win where they differ:
  - **Like the final Bowser, as a woodpecker** (the owner, 31 October 2026: "Bowser 2 in Super Mario 64 is what I always compare my imagined woodpecker to, and it doesn't break down the map until there is no space.", then "sorry! final bowser!"; to the design session's take: "Yes, though I don't know about in a few big moments, I think perhaps I like what we've planned already better. Fits a woodpecker. but what if it takes few chunks at once, but it is cutting out a shape, and when that shape is no longer attached to anyhting, it falls? I really like your idea about a floor, and how it continues to peck which you must avoid, without taking out much anymore. maybe just a tile here and there in the late late game. what do you think, expert?"; then "Yes, I think that's it. can still be jumpable gaps, but we want to avoid the islands stuff. it becomes too much rng, and isn't very exciting."). It cuts shapes, never melts the log:
    - **A few cells a peck, along an outline.** Its pecks trace a dotted cut across the log, so everyone can watch the outline close round a piece; when the last peck cuts it loose, the piece falls away (2s's rule). The gaze in act 1 says where it will start cutting. The last peck is warned like any strike, and a snake still on the piece falls with it ("Down the hole!"), unless it crawled or jumped off in time; it never cuts loose a piece a snake couldn't leave in the warning's time ("The woodpecker plays fair"). The draft's combos give way to the outline. **It aims small, nothing is banned** (the owner, 31 October 2026: "No outline should be banned from falling, but ideally, it never takes out half the trunk."): it plans its outlines round edges and corners, pieces small next to the log (about a sixth at most, a first guess), and never plans a cut that halves the trunk; but no size is banned from falling, so a piece that ends up cut loose falls, whatever its size, by 2s's rule. Measured: the biggest piece that fell in a round.
    - **A floor.** It cuts shapes only while the log is bigger than the room the snakes left need to play (about twice their length together, a first guess, set by simulation). At the floor it stops cutting.
    - **Then it fights.** At the floor it keeps pecking at the snakes, aimed and warned (its rings), so they must dodge; a peck that catches a snake is a crash, never instant death, and never unavoidable ("No refuges" both ways). It takes only a tile here and there in the very late game.
    - **It cuts where there is the most log per snake,** never at random, so whose piece goes next never decides a round. Measured: how often a round is decided by where it cut, with the draft's "the biggest island not deciding the round".
  - **Hunger stays a factor to the end: food a conditional good.** Today food and beads only hurt at the end, since length fills the room. Balanced so a meal is a real trade-off there too, as the mushrooms are: life bought against room cost, each winning sometimes. The hunger clock is tuned with the bird's pace for it. Measured by three versions of the rivals head to head in the endgame: ones that always eat, ones that never eat, and 2h's weighing. Neither always nor never may win; the weighing must, and both starving and boxed-in deaths must show among the endgame's causes.

- Also: an A/B test of food knocked aside against food falling into the hole, with a `?food=fall` knob for the owner's playtests.
- If the knock stays, it gets bark chips spraying out and a little bounce where it lands.
- **Skeletons for the dead, beside the memorials** (the owner, 2 November 2026; lost from the queue when round six's plan was archived): vertebrae beads in the snake's colours and a skull wearing its trademark, still food at a glance (crash drops stay beads; rot bleaches and crumbles them), and every rival's trademark memorial on the head tile for about 15 s, as "Skeletons for the dead" and "Trademark memorials" in `docs/archive/plan-history.md` list them. On the food A/B above, the owner leans to falling.
- Ghost's memorial: the planned smoke wisp, or the owner's idea of a broken shackle with a few chain links. Ghost's tongue stays smoke.
- The earlier "the bird eats the food" variant for that A/B is in `tools/dev/r6-study-tools/patch-flex3.js` (PECK_FOOD).

### 7. Then: local multiplayer (PR D)

As planned: up to 4 players, key sets, gamepads, and local and online play together.

### 8. Near the end: beetles who meet, fight (the owner, 29 October 2026; an engine-rules entry, last but the writing pass)

Two beetles that meet fight a shoving match, and a snake that gets there in time can catch them while they do; last of the rules, before the writing pass. Spec: `docs/handoff/queue-specs.md`, "8. Near the end: beetles who meet, fight".

### 9. At the very end: the writing pass (the owner, 31 October 2026; Fable 5.1, after everything else, entry 8 included)

Every rival's lines given a make-over by a Fable 5.1 session with creative control, outside what the owner protects: his own lines, the lines he likes, and the gags (Mason's bad Latin, "vidi vici veni"). After everything else, so it covers every line the queue adds. Spec: `docs/handoff/queue-specs.md`, "9. At the very end: the writing pass".
